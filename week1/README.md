Hi, I've started my developer diary today! It's not all fancy bancy but, I will write down the story related to the developing for to look back what I've done. And I actually think it will help me to clarify what is going on and actually see the better direction of where I am going.

Study hours:

- The Odin Project: 13:30~16:00 (5 tomato)
- Making a Git Tutorial for the coding club:(9 tomato) 
    - 10:00~12:00
    - 18:00~18:30
    - 20:30~22:30

I have not been able to put too much effort in `The Odin Project`. I wish I can put more time into it. As is the good guidanced curriculum for becoming a web developer. I will need to decided how many hours I need to spend on TOP.

Today, I was not able to do some practice on TOP. But I also know TOP should not be skipped. What should I do?
